# Planning JPP Telkomsel Dashboard

# Objective: 
The objective of this project was to create an interactive and informative dashboard using Looker Studio to visualize Telkomsel's data for the first and second semesters. This dashboard allows stakeholders to easily analyze and interpret budget and performance data, enabling more informed decision-making.

# Data Sources:
1. Resume Sheet: Provides summary data including budgets, targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for each quarter and overall semesters.
2. LOP (List of Projects): Contains raw project data which includes detailed information about each project such as status, design type, total BOQ, Capex per port, and other relevant metrics.
3. Pivot Sheets (PV JPP Q1, PV JPP Q2, PV PT3 Instan Q1): Generated pivot tables from the LOP data to summarize and aggregate data for each specific quarter and instant PT3 projects.

# Dashboard Features:
1. Used Budget and Remaining Budget Analysis:
- Visualizations that display the utilized budget against the total allocated budget for Semester 1 and 2, as well as for each quarter.
- Analysis of remaining budget to ensure efficient financial planning and tracking.

2. Realized Ports and Unrealized Ports Analysis:
- Charts depicting the number of ports that have been realized compared to those that are yet to be realized.
- Insight into progress towards port targets, helping identify areas that require attention.

3. Average CPP (Cost Per Port) Analysis:
- Visual representation of the average CPP for different projects and branches.
- Helps in assessing cost efficiency and identifying any deviations from the budgeted CPP.

4. Order Status Analysis:
- Detailed breakdown of the status of orders, including submitted, in-progress, and completed orders.
- Provides a clear view of the current status of all projects and helps in tracking project progress.

5. Project Status Analysis:
- Overview of the status of various projects, categorized by different stages such as design, approval, and execution.
- Facilitates monitoring of project timelines and identifying bottlenecks.

6. Projects Requiring Approval:
- Specific focus on projects that are pending approval, highlighting critical tasks that need attention.
- Ensures timely approvals and helps in maintaining project schedules.

# Process Overview:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- Collected raw project data from the LOP sheet.
- Generated pivot tables for each quarter and instant PT3 projects to create summarized views of the data.
- Prepared the Resume sheet with aggregate data including budgets, targets, and KPIs for quick reference.

2. Dashboard Development in Looker Studio:
- Connected the prepared data sheets (Resume, PV JPP Q1, PV JPP Q2, PV PT3 Instan Q1) to Looker Studio.
- Created interactive visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, and tables to represent the data effectively.
- Designed the dashboard layout to ensure clarity and ease of navigation for users.

3. Validation and Testing:
- Validated the accuracy of the visualized data against the source sheets.
- Conducted testing with potential users to ensure the dashboard meets user requirements and is easy to use.

# Outcomes:
- Enhanced visibility into Telkomselâ€™s BOQ data for Semester 1 and 2, allowing for better tracking of budget utilization and project performance.
- Improved decision-making through detailed and interactive visualizations of key performance metrics.
- Streamlined reporting process by consolidating data into a single, user-friendly dashboard.

# Tools Used:
- Looker Studio: For creating and hosting the interactive dashboard.
- Google Sheets: For data preparation and pivot table generation.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data visualization, data analysis, and dashboard design using Looker Studio, showcasing the ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.
